# A program for sentiment analysis of Japanese documents, and their English translations.
This is E2J_sent, a work-in-progress program which uses a DistilBERT model to analyze the sentiment valence of Japanese documents against English translations.
This is my first in-depth progress working with PyTorch and Huggingface models, for the purpose of hopefully lending a computational perspective to judging the accuracy of translations between English and Japanese documents.

# Tools used:
- Huggingface
- PyTorch
- Python
- etc.
